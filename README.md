### Flask-Starter

Just a tiny Flask example project. There are three goals here:

* To give you a working Flask project, so you can understand how Flask works
* To give an example of a working HTML form, so you can use forms in your applications
* To provide a project where you can add new pages that demonstrate what you have learned.

#### To get this running on your machine

* Fork this Repo (requires being signed in to GitHub)
* Clone the fork to your machine (requires having Git installed on your machine)
* Execute `$ python app.py` at the project root
